        <h2>
          I am a software engineer with a proven track record in education and
          genomic analysis. I have a passion for solving complex problems
          methodically, and writing consistently organized code that is easily
          transferable between team members. I believe that effective
          communication is the foundation of successful teams. I thrive in
          collaborative environments where there is a balance of shared and
          individual responsibilities.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          In my free time, I enjoy traveling with my family, hiking and camping,
          and playing Board Games. The board game I am playing the most right
          now is "Frosthaven".

          Previously, as an educator, I created environments where teams and
          their members could be successful.

          Whether building applications, or playing board-games, my greatest
          satisfaction is solving complex problems.

          I thrive in collaborative environments where shared vision, curiosity,
          and continuous improvement are prioritized.
